ssh bandit29@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

download the git repo first, just like previous level. DON'T FORGET TO PUT THE PORT NUMBER

bandit29@bandit:/tmp/tmp.gLklDEvFBc$ git clone ssh://bandit29-git@localhost:2220/home/bandit29-git/repo

cd repo

git log and git status all are ok.. there's no leak.
BUT, there might other branches that leaks the info

bandit29@bandit:/tmp/tmp.gLklDEvFBc/repo$ git branch -a

you might see there is another branch 'dev'

bandit29@bandit:/tmp/tmp.gLklDEvFBc/repo$ git checkout dev

bandit29@bandit:/tmp/tmp.gLklDEvFBc/repo$ ls
code  README.md

But both have nothing. We might guess that the leak is in the initial commits

bandit29@bandit:/tmp/tmp.gLklDEvFBc/repo$ git log
bandit29@bandit:/tmp/tmp.gLklDEvFBc/repo$ git show 2b1395f00cfb986163082c50100be5be8f249f64
