ssh bandit20@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

first just run the setuid binary to get the usage:

we have to open a server (on localhost with any random port no)

nc -lvp 4040

-l == server is listening for tcp/udp
-v == will have a verbose output
-p == port no

go to another window of terminal and run the binary file to connect to the server 

./suconnect 4040

Then put the current password on the listening port of 4040
then setuid binary will reply the correct output.
